Description: This is a test package I developed to exhibit how an R package is created for the 7-5-2023 joint lab meeting. It consists of a pair of datasets containing A549 TADs and primary AT2-like AEC H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks, as well as a funciton which identifies the regions in one dataset which overlap with another.
